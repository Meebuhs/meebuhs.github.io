Maze runner was built while I was completing my artificial intelligence course at uni. I was looking for a project to work on and I wanted to try my hand at implementing some of the search algorithms that I was learning about.

## Maze Generation

Mazes are generated using a [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) which searches a branch to its full depth before backtracking to explore other options. By starting with a full grid and removing walls as the search algorithm moves from cell to cell, it is guaranteed that any two cells in the maze are connected by a single path and there are no cycles.

## Maze Saving

Mazes are saved to a plaintext file where the first line contains the dimensions of the maze on the first line in the format `columns rows`. Since the cells are arranged in a rectangular grid, each cell only has bottom and right walls to remove the need to render duplicated cell walls. Each following line is then 2 binary digits representing a cell and encoding which walls are present, `bottom right`. Therefore, each maze must have `columns*rows + 1` lines. Some examples of valid maze files can be seen [here](https://github.com/Meebuhs/maze-runner/tree/master/mazerunner/mazes).

## Maze Solving

There are currently seven solvers supported. These algorithms are all very well documented online, so I won't go into any real detail about them here, however, the algorithms featured in maze runner include:

### Uninformed Search

These solver's don't have any information about where the goal is.

#### Breadth First Search (BFS)

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/maze-runner/bfs.gif" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="Maze Runner - Breadth First Search" data-echo="/assets/images/maze-runner/bfs.gif" />
</a></div>

Breadth first search will explore all cells at a given depth before moving on to cells which are further away. This means all branches are explored equally and is done by adding cells to a queue as they're discovered.

#### Depth First Search (DFS)

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/maze-runner/dfs.gif" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="Maze Runner - Depth First Search" data-echo="/assets/images/maze-runner/dfs.gif" />
</a></div>

Depth first search operates similarly to BFS except uses a stack instead of a queue. This means that the latest added cell is visited first and thus will continue down one branch until it ends before backtracking to check elsewhere.

#### Random Sample Search

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/maze-runner/random.gif" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="Maze Runner - Random Sample Search" data-echo="/assets/images/maze-runner/random.gif" />
</a></div>

A random sample search is performed by randomly placing many points on the search space (this number is configurable in `util/Config.py`) and using these points to construct a graph. Maze runner constructs and adjacency matrix, linking each point with all other reachable points within a certain distance. A point is considered reachable if a straight line path between the two points does not intersect a cell wall. This graph is then searched using `Dijkstra's algorithm` to find the shortest path between the start and end cells. 

### Bi-directional Uninformed Search

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/maze-runner/bi-bfs.gif" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="Maze Runner - Bi Directional Breadth First Search" data-echo="/assets/images/maze-runner/bi-bfs.gif" />
</a></div>

These searches operate the same way as the uninformed searches above except that they start from both the start and end cells.

It includes both bi-directional BFS and DFS.

### Informed Seach

Informed searches have information about how far away the goal is which allows them to make more intelligent decisions about the path that they take.

#### Greedy Best First Search

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/maze-runner/greedy.gif" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="Maze Runner - Greedy Best First Search" data-echo="/assets/images/maze-runner/greedy.gif" />
</a></div>

Greedy best first search is true to its name, always choosing to visit the neighbouring cell which is the closest to the goal. The distance used to compare is the [manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) from the cell to the goal.

#### A* Search

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/maze-runner/astar.gif" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="Maze Runner - A* Search" data-echo="/assets/images/maze-runner/astar.gif" />
</a></div>

A* operates similarly to greedy, except it also takes into account the distance travelled to reach a cell.  

## Possible Improvements

- It is currently the case that updating the display is far more intensive than running the search algorithms. It would be nice to add multithreading so that they operate independently.
- Add the ability to control the speed at which the algorithm progresses.
- Add other search spaces, and search algorithms for them, such as continous 2D or 3D.
- Provide statistics about memory usage, cells visited, operations completed etc.
