One of the first coding projects I ever wrote was a chrome extension to replace the new tab page with a grid of my most used sites. It was purely HTML and CSS and was a hardcoded table with images I had made in photoshop. It was honestly really handy but it was way too much effort to create a new tile image, change the code and redeploy so it was never updated.  

This project is a revival in tribute of my first attempt. It is built with a modern development stack with ease of customisation as the main goal.

## Technology

Built with:
 - Webpack (4.x)
 - Babel (7.x)
 - Typescript (3.x)
 - React (16.x)
 - Redux (4.x)
 - Reselect
 - Sass

Development server using:
 - webpack-dev-server

Style-checking:
 - Prettier
 - Tslint
 - Stylelint & stylelint-config-sass-guidelines

Tested with:
 - Jest
 - Enzyme
 - redux-mock-store

## State Management

There is one global state for the project and `reselect` and `redux` are used to manage it. 

`reselect` is used to define selectors.

[selectors/grid.ts](https://github.com/Meebuhs/newtab/blob/master/src/newtab/selectors/grid.ts)
{% highlight typescript %}
/**
 * Returns the grid state from the root state
 * @param {IState} state The root state of the app
 */
export const getGrid = (state: IState) => state.grid

export const getTiles = createSelector([getGrid], s => s.tiles)
{% endhighlight %}

Which are then used to pass some of the state to the ui components via the `props` of their container.

[containers/EditableGrid.tsx](https://github.com/Meebuhs/newtab/blob/master/src/newtab/containers/EditableGrid.tsx)
{% highlight typescript %}
const mapStateToProps = (state: IState) => ({
  tiles: getTiles(state),
})
{% endhighlight %}

In order to alter the state, the components can dispatch an `action` via functions which are also passed through their container's props. 

[containers/EditableGrid.tsx](https://github.com/Meebuhs/newtab/blob/master/src/newtab/containers/EditableGrid.tsx)
{% highlight typescript %}
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: any) => ({
  handleReorderColumn: (
    columnOrder: string[],
    startIndex: number,
    endIndex: number
  ) => dispatch(reorderColumn(columnOrder, startIndex, endIndex)),
})
{% endhighlight %}

These actions are simply an identifier for the `reducer` function and a `payload` containing the information needed to perform the state modification.

[actions/grid.ts](https://github.com/Meebuhs/newtab/blob/master/src/newtab/actions/grid.ts)
{% highlight typescript %}
/**
 * Reorder the column order of the grid.
 * @param {string[]} columnOrder The current columnOrder array
 * @param {number} startIndex The index the column started at before being dragged
 * @param {number} endIndex The index at which the column was dropped
 */
export function reorderColumn(
  columnOrder: string[],
  startIndex: number,
  endIndex: number
): IReorderColumnAction {
  return {
    type: REORDER_COLUMN,
    payload: {
      columnOrder,
      startIndex,
      endIndex,
    },
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The reducer then performs the required modifications to the state.

[reducers/grid.ts](https://github.com/Meebuhs/newtab/blob/master/src/newtab/reducers/grid.ts)
{% highlight typescript %}
/**
 * Reducer function for the grid state
 * @param {IGridState} state The current state of the grid, initialState if none provided
 * @param {Action} action The action to handle. The possible actions are declared in src/actions/grid.ts
 */
export function reducer(state: IGridState = initialState, action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case REORDER_COLUMN: {
      /**
       * Rearranges the column order within the grid moving the column from startIndex to endIndex.
       */
      const { columnOrder, startIndex, endIndex } = action.payload
      const newColumnOrder = Array.from(columnOrder)
      const [removed] = newColumnOrder.splice(startIndex, 1)
      newColumnOrder.splice(endIndex, 0, removed)

      return {
        ...state,
        columnOrder: newColumnOrder,
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Testing

This method of state management allows the state logic to be isolated and tested seperately from the UI code. 
- Using Jest it is easy to pass a state into the reducer and test that the expected result is returned. 
- Using redux-mock-store it is easy to test that actions are being correctly dispatched.
- Enzyme can then be used to ensure that the UI components are being rendered as expected.

Combining these three methods of testing allows for excellent test coverage without much overhead.

## Functionality

Opening the sidebar puts the grid into edit mode whereas closing the sidebar saves any changes made to `localStorage`.

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/newtab/edit-tile.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="newtab - create or edit a tile" data-echo="/assets/images/newtab/edit-tile.png" />
</a></div>

When creating or editing a tile there are a range of display options available including a solid background colour, a gradient or an image.

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/newtab/animated-backgrounds.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="newtab - page background options" data-echo="/assets/images/newtab/animated-backgrounds.png" />
</a></div>

The page background has a couple extra options allowing you to choose an animated particle system or an image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) randomly selected from the results of a user-specified search query.

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/newtab/drag-tile.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="newtab - drag and drop reordering" data-echo="/assets/images/newtab/drag-tile.png" />
</a></div>

The tiles are simply dragged and dropped in order to arrange them as desired.

<div class="clickable-image"><a href="/assets/images/newtab/restore-settings.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/blank.png" alt="newtab - drag and drop reordering" data-echo="/assets/images/newtab/restore-settings.png" />
</a></div>

Finally, the extension allows you to import or export your settings to back them up, transfer between computers or share with friends.
